## Service Pre-requisites 

![Requires SSH Connection](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_tcdeploy/getstarted/console_ssh_required.png)


> NHN Cloud Deploy delivers deployment commands via SSH connection. 
> Before deployment, it must be connected with a target server via SSH, so preparation is required, such as target server IP, port, and exceptions for firewall.  
>


### Requirements for Each OS 
#### Linux 
* curl 7.19.7-43 or higher versions  

#### Window
* Requires SSH Installation 
    * SSH Shell: PowerShell specified  

### Requirements for NHN Cloud VM Deployment 
#### Assign Public IP  
* For the deployment of NHN Cloud VM instances, create a [Floating IP](https://gov-docs.toast.com/zh/Compute/Instance/zh/console-guide/#ip_1) for VM instance and assign public IP. 

#### Add Security Exceptions 
* Add IP for Deploy (as below) to [Security Group](https://gov-docs.toast.com/zh/Compute/Instance/zh/console-guide/#_13) of a VM instance to deploy, as part of the SSH rule. 
```
211.56.2.51/32
211.56.2.52/32
```
##### Note) Adding Exceptions for Security  

![deploy_01_201812](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_tcdeploy/deploy_01_201812.png)

1. Select **Instance** from **Compute** on the NHN Cloud console.
2. Select the security group set for VM, or click **+ Create Security Group** to create a new security group. 
3. Click **+ Add Rules**. 
    * Rule: Choose SSH.
    * Enter IP at CIDR.
    * Bandwidth may be required. (e.g. 211.56.2.51/32, 211.56.2.52/32).

### Requirements for Server Deployment Other than NHN Cloud VM 
#### Assign Public IP 
* To connect SSH, public IP must be assigned. 

#### Configure Firewalls and Network ACL 
* Add exceptions on network and firewall, for the following IPs, so as to allow external access. 
```
211.56.2.51/32
211.56.2.52/32
```
